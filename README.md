### Project Title: **Student Record Management System**

### Project Description:

The **Student Record Management System** is a simple C-based console application designed to manage and store student information such as their name, roll number, class, and subject marks. This system dynamically allocates memory for storing students' marks based on the number of subjects, calculates the percentage for each student, and displays the student data along with their percentage on the console. Furthermore, the application also saves the student information, including their marks and percentage, to a text file for future reference.

The program provides functionality to:
- Input student details like name, roll number, class, and marks in different subjects.
- Dynamically calculate the student's percentage based on the total marks obtained.
- Display the student details, marks, and percentage in a tabular format.
- Save the student information to an external text file for storage.

This project can be used as a basic tool in educational institutions to keep track of student performance or can be extended to include more features such as grade calculation, error handling, or adding more student-specific information.

**Key Features**:
- Dynamically stores student marks for multiple subjects using dynamic memory allocation.
- Calculates and displays the student's percentage.
- Saves student records to a file for future reference.
- Displays information in a formatted table in both the console and the output file.

This project helps demonstrate basic concepts of C programming, including structs, dynamic memory allocation, file handling, and loops.
